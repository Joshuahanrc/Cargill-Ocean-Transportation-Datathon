# Cargill Ocean Transportation Datathon

This repository contains a comprehensive decision-support system for Cargill's Maritime Logistics Optimization, using Python and data science techniques to maximize profitability and simulate market volatility.

## Objective 


Our project focuses on the following key objectives:

1. Freight Calculation & Optimization: Build a robust freight calculator to evaluate and rank multiple voyage options for Capesize vessels, ensuring 100% fulfillment of committed contractual obligations.

2. Scenario Sensitivity Analysis: Conduct iterative stress tests on market variables—specifically bunker prices—to understand how changing market conditions impact vessel employment recommendations.
